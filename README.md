# csv_to_parquet

Parquet file format offers several advantages over CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, particularly in the realm of big data processing and storage. One significant advantage is its columnar storage approach. In a CSV file, data is stored row by row, which can be inefficient for analytical queries that involve selecting specific columns. Parquet, on the other hand, stores data column-wise, allowing for more efficient read and query operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Additionally, Parquet files are highly optimized for compression. They leverage various compression techniques, such as run-length encoding and dictionary encoding, to minimize storage space without sacrificing query performance. This makes Parquet files ideal for storing and processing massive amounts of data in distributed computing environments like Hadoop and Spark.

Furthermore, Parquet files support complex data types and nested structures, making them versatile for a wide range of use cases, including data analytics, machine learning, and data warehousing.

Implement the CSV to Parquet converter

1. Install the package:
